# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Project

📌 Project Description:

* This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using various machine learning classification algorithms. The objective is to analyze medical and health-related attributes of patients and build predictive models that can accurately identify individuals at risk of heart disease.

* The dataset undergoes preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships and data distribution. Multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Means Clustering, are implemented and evaluated using mean squared error, r2-score, accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report metrics. The performance of each algorithm is compared to identify the most effective model.

* This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison using python and scikit-learn.
